**Know Problems**

Unfortunately there are some problems you might encounter while using our app.

*Story Audio:*
- After pressing on the Play Button in the Middle of the Detail Page after a scan, the audio is loaded and you are automatically switched to the player view. However you wont be able to play the audio in this stage.
What to do:
- Go back to the Detail Page via the arrow on the left side
- Press the Play Button again
- If you still cant hear anything, turn on your notification sounds

*Map/ Homescreen:*
- Pressing on a Location Needle sometimes needs two tries before it will show you the Description Page
